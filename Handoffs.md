# Spinning Up a Full Stack Node.js App â€” Helping Your Future Self

Starting a full stack Node.js app can be fun but also confusing. There are many steps and it is easy to forget where you stopped.  
Agile self-handoffs can help you remember what to do next by leaving clear notes for your future self.

## My Experience

- I started building my Node.js app with MongoDB for storing user data.
- I stopped in the middle of setting up my database.
- When I came back, I forgot what I was doing and wasted a lot of time.
- After that, I began writing short notes and commit messages before stopping work.

## Agile Handoffs

- In Agile work, a handoff is when one person gives their work to another.
- This can also mean giving your work to your future self.
- When you stop coding, your future self needs to know what was done and what to do next.
- Leaving notes is called a self-handoff.

## Why Self-Handoffs Matter

- Save time because you do not have to remember everything
- Reduce stress and confusion
- Keep track of your choices
- Make it easier if other people join your project later

---

## How I Do Self-Handoffs

- Write a TODO file before stopping work
- Use clear commit messages that say what I finished and what comes next
- Write down how to restart the project if I need to set it up again

---

## Example TODO File

- Use Render to make your stunning-octo app go live
- Fix issues mentioned by Dr Cumbie and push changes
- Connect MongoDB collection for user feedback
- Add validation for storing user responses in MongoDB

---

## Example Commit Message

- git commit -m "Add feature to record user responses and save to MongoDB"

---

## Why This Helps

- When I open my project the next day, I know what to do next
- I do not waste time trying to remember what I was working on
- It makes my project easier to understand
